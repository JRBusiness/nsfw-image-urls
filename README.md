# Introduction
The nsfw-image-urls repository contains a large collection of URLs to pornographic images which can be used to train NSFW image classifiers or be used in machine learning projects. A variety of categories have been provided to ensure a diverse selection of images for the best and most accurate results.

These images were taken from [Reddit](https://reddit.com) using the following rules:
1. The URL returned a 200 status code.
2. The URL took less than 10 seconds to respond.
3. The content-type of the response was 'image/*', excluding 'image/gif'.
4. URLs that returned an error graphic indicating the original image had been deleted were not included.
